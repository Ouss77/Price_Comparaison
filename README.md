The project is a Full Stack MERN web application that allows users to compare prices of hotels from multiple websites. 
It utilizes web scraping technology to extract data from popular hotel booking sites such as Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor,
and displays the prices side-by-side in a clean and intuitive interface.

The backend of the application is built with Node.js and Express, which handles the web scraping and data processing. 
The extracted data is stored in a MongoDB database, which allows for efficient data management and retrieval.

The frontend of the application is developed with React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for users to compare hotel prices. 
Users can search for hotels in a specific location and select the dates they wish to stay, and the application will retrieve the prices from
the selected websites and display them in a table format. Users can sort the table by price, website, or rating, and click on a specific hotel to view more information.

The project is highly scalable, as it can easily be adapted to scrape data from additional hotel booking sites or expand 
to include other travel-related information such as flight prices or car rental rates. It is also deployed on a cloud-based
platform such as Heroku, making it easily accessible to users around the world.

Overall, the project demonstrates the use of cutting-edge technologies such as web scraping, MongoDB,
and React to solve a real-world problem and provides a valuable tool for consumers looking to find the best deals on hotel prices.
